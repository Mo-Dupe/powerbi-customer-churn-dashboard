# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

Welcome to my **Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard**, a Power BI project designed to explore key patterns behind customer churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This dashboard answers one of the most critical business questions:
> **Why are customers leaving, and how can we reduce churn?**

Using visual storytelling and DAX-driven insights, I analysed customer demographics, contracts, internet services, group behaviours, and engagement patterns to surface churn drivers.

## 🧩 Key Dashboard Sections

### 1. **Data Overview**
A summary page displaying key metrics like total customers, churn rate, and average monthly charges—plus a state-wise churn distribution.

### 2. **Churn Rate Analysis**
> *Business Question:* Which contract types and customer segments are churning most?

Breaks down churn by contract type, group customers, and charge patterns.

### 3. **Churn Reasons Analysis**
> *Business Question:* What are the top reasons customers are leaving?

Bar charts and treemaps visualise top churn drivers, while detailed insights uncover patterns by reason and tenure.

### 4. **Customer Demographics & Churn Patterns**
> *Business Question:* Who is churning? What do they have in common?

Segmented by gender, age, senior citizen status, and combined demographic labels. High-risk groups are identified using custom DAX.

### 5. **Group Contracts & Retention**
> *Business Question:* Are customers in group contracts less likely to churn?

Insightful comparison of churn rate by contract type across group and non-group customers.

### 6. **Customer Engagement**
> *Business Question:* Are higher engagement or support calls driving churn?

This section analyses churn patterns by customer support activity, device protection, and spending behaviour.
